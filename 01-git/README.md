# Lesson 1: Gitting into it!

**Date:** Feb 9th, 2026

## Overview

Welcome to your first step into professional software development! Today we aren't just learning commands; we are learning how to collaborate, save our work safely, and manage the history of our projects.

## Agenda

1. **What is Version Control?**

   - Why do we need it? (No more `final_final_v2.docx`)
   - Centralized vs Distributed (Git).

2. **Core Concepts**

   - **Repository (Repo)**: The folder where your project lives.
   - **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific time.
   - **Stage (Add)**: Preparing files for a commit.
   - **Branch**: A parallel version of your code (like a timeline split).

3. **The "Happy Path" Workflow**

   1. `git status` (Always check where you are!)
   2. `git add .` (Stage changes)
   3. `git commit -m "message"` (Save changes)
   4. `git push` (Send to GitHub)

4. **Branching & Merging**

   - Why branch? To work on features without breaking the main code.
   - `git checkout -b new-feature`
   - `git merge new-feature`

5. **The Scary Part: Merge Conflicts**
   - What happens when two people change the same line?
   - How to resolve them calmly.

## Class Activity

We will pair up and try to edit the same file in a shared repository to trigger a merge conflict intentionally!
